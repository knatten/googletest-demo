This is the code I ended up with in my demo of GoogleTest for Kjeller Software Community and Oslo C++ Users Group.

The imaginary task we solved was to create a no-fly list for the new American president Mitt Romney. His criteria for being grounded ended up being:
-If you are a terrorist
-If you are a French liberal
-If you have ever tweeted about bombs, Osama or Obama

The best part is that there turned out to be a French liberal in the audience, who decided to fork the project to allow himself to fly. Check out Cyrille Verrier's fork at https://github.com/cyrillev/googletest-demo
